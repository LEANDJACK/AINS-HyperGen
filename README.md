# AINS HyperGen
!!READ THIS README THOROUGHLY!!

Made with ❤

This application is a automation tool, and it is meant to increase the efficiency for the users of Advanced Intergrated Nilam System(AINS) by simulating and automating the inputs using AI (ChatGPT specifically) that are usually done by us humans otherwise. This tool is meant for educational purposes, and are not meant for abusing or any other kinds of havoc.

If you are experinced in this type of things and want to help contribute to this project, then feel free to [pull a request](https://github.com/leandjack/ains-hypergen/pulls)

If you have a problem/suggestion with the tool, please [submit an issue here](https://github.com/leandjack/ains-hypergen/issues/new).

This tool is only meant for Windows devices with Google Chrome version 120 and later.

## Frequently Asked Questions
 **Q: Is this a malware?**
 
 **A:** No. The source code here is viewable to all, and I don't get paid enough anyways to hack into your computer, and I won't benefit from doing so.
 THAT IS if you are downloading the tool from here only, of course.

 **Q: Can using this get me banned?**
 
 **A:** The purpose of the AINS is to encourage people to read books and understand what they are reading. The mere existense of this tool defeats that purpose and is unethical. Fortunately, if your school's administrator isn't all that sharp eyed and you are not abusing this to the point that they notice it immediately, you probably
 won't get banned. 😏


## Features
1. Automatically fill in the AINS book form with minimal control by humans
2. Supports language switching (only Bahasa Melayu and English are supported at the moment)
3. (what did you expect from a small tool that was made in two weeks by a complete beginner)

## Installing
Download the [latest release of the tool](https://github.com/leandjack/ains-hypergen/tags), extract the .zip file using the Windows Explorer inbuilt into your computer, and run the .exe. No download is required, it is just that simple.

Note: There is 2 files in the folder once you extract the .ZIP file, namely output.txt and apikey.txt. Please do touch touch the files, if you don't know what you are doing, as that may cause instabilities in the tool

You should not need any other software or drivers to make this tool work, but if you have any problems running this tool, feel free to [submit a issue](https://github.com/leandjack/ains-hypergen/issues/new) and let me know and this tool is still in very early stages of its development.

Windows Smartscreen may show a popup when you run this tool for the first time. This happens because it is a unknown program, not because it is actaully a malware. To dismiss it, just click on "More info" and then "Run anyway."

## Code
this tool is entirely made with python with dependecies such as pynput and so on.
